## Overview
### Description
#### Airbnb for bikes & scooters:
- **Description:** Bike owners and scooter owners can put their bike/scooter up for sale and users can rent the bike/scooter from them 

#### Student Matching App: 
- **Description**: Connects incoming college freshmen to other incoming freshmen in their area so that students can get to know each other before they begin college
 

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]

#### Airbnb for bikes & scooters:
- **Category**: Lifestyle 
- **Mobile**: Users are able to browse available bikes and scooters in close proximity to them, organizing the layout by location, price, seller reputation
- **Story**: Connects people who need eco friendly transportation to people who are willing to rent theirs
- **Market**: The market for this would be very large, as a lot of people use bikes and scooters on the daily, especially on large college campuses. 
- **Habit:** This app is not necessarily addictive, but rather the need for transportation and the addictiveness of biking will cause users to use this app. Users can save money by avoiding to purchase a bike or scooter. Bike owners will use this to make more money off of their bike or scooter
- **Scope**: V1 would allow bike owners and bike seekers to make a profile. V2 would allow bike seekers to view bike owners bikes in the area. V3 would incorporate some third party messaging tool (opens email). V4 would incorporate an internal messaging tool
